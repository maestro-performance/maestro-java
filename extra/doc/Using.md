Maestro: Using
============

Maestro tests are written in Groovy. By default, it already comes with a library of tests 
for single and multi host testing. Additional tests can be written by using the provided 
test API. 

Preparing for the Test Execution
----

The test parameters are exported as environment variables.  It is done this way to facilitate
the integration with continuous integration systems such as Jenkins. As such, the first step 
required for any test is to export the appropriate variables.

The variables to be exported vary if the software under test is deployed in single or in multi
node topologies. This different topologies are referenced as singlepoint and multipoint within
Maestro. Additionally, the variables may vary according to the test - and custom tests may have
their own variables. The default set of tests provided with Maestro is documented in greater
detail in further sections of this document.

Overall, the base set of variables for the tests are: 

**Singlepoint Test Variables**: 

| Variable Name    | Default Value       | Description          |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `MAESTRO_BROKER` | `null` | The URL for the Maestro broker |
| `SEND_RECEIVE_URL` | `null` | The URL for the SUT (ie.: ```amqp://testhost/queue```) with options (see below) |
| `MESSAGE_SIZE` | `null` | The [message size](MessageSize.md) |
| `TEST_DURATION` | `null` | The [test duration](TestDuration.md) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `null` | Optional log level (see below) |
| `MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE` | `null` | The URL for the [management interface](Inspectors.md) |
| `INSPECTOR_NAME` | `null` | The name of the [inspector](Inspectors.md) |
| `DOWNLOADER_NAME` | `null` | The report download method (see below) |


**Multipoint Test Variables**: 

| Variable Name    | Default Value       | Description          |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `MAESTRO_BROKER` | `null` | The URL for the Maestro broker |
| `SEND_URL` | `null` | The URL for sending data to the SUT (ie.: ```amqp://testhost/queue```) with options (see below) |
| `RECEIVE_URL` | `null` | The URL for receiving data from the SUT (ie.: ```amqp://testhost/queue```) with options (see below) |
| `MESSAGE_SIZE` | `null` | The [message size](MessageSize.md) |
| `TEST_DURATION` | `null` | The [test duration](TestDuration.md) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `null` | Optional log level (see below) |
| `MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE` | `null` | The URL for the [management interface](Inspectors.md) |
| `INSPECTOR_NAME` | `null` | The name of the [inspector](Inspectors.md) |
| `DOWNLOADER_NAME` | `null` | The report download method (see below) |
| `DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY` | `balanced` | Determines how to distribute the worker pool (see below) |
| `ENDPOINT_RESOLVER_NAME` | `role` | Determines how to distribute the test endpoints among the worker pool (see below) |

Default Tests
----

Maestro comes with a set of default tests. Those tests are provided along with the
Maestro client package and can be found in the script directory of the client install.
The most relevant tests are:

* Single Point
  * FixedRateTest.groovy: a test can can send data at a fixed rate.
  * IncrementalTest.groovy: a test that keeps increasing the rate if the test is successful.
  * FairIncrementalTest.groovy: a test that keeps increasing the rate in a **fair** way if the test is successful.

* Multi Point
  * FixedRateTest.groovy: a test can can send data at a fixed rate.
  * IncrementalTest.groovy: a test that keeps increasing the rate if the test is successful.
  * FairIncrementalTest.groovy: a test that keeps increasing the rate in a **fair** way if the test is successful.

The different between the incremental tests and the fair incremental test is that the first 
do not take into consideration the number of connections per worker, whereas the second will
balance the rate on the SUT according to the number of connections per worker.

**Log Level**

Log level can be adjusted by setting the LOG_LEVEL variable to one of the following values:

* trace
* debug
* info
* warn

The default log level is "info".

**Report Downloaders**

After the test is complete, Maestro Client downloads the files for processing them and creating the reports. The files 

* Pooled: in this method, the client requests the peers on the test cluster to push the logs into the Maestro broker 
into a specific topic for logs. Then, the client downloads those files concurrently. 
* Broker method via MQTT: in this method, the client requests the peers on the test cluster to push the logs into the 
Maestro broker into a specific topic for logs. Then, the client downloads those files one at a time. 

Configuring the Report Download Method

* Broker method via MQTT
  * Used whenever the environment variable DOWNLOADER_NAME is set to "broker"
  * Optional client configuration is available on ```maestro-cli.properties```.
  * Optional worker configuration is available on ```maestro-worker.properties```.
* Pooled
  * Used whenever the environment variable DOWNLOADER_NAME is set to "pooled-broker"

**Distribution Strategy**

Starting with Maestro 1.5, there is no more dedicated roles to the workers. As a result, the code launches a "worker"
daemon that can act either as a receiver or as a sender, according to the test needs. In order to distribute the worker
pool, it is necessary to set a distribution strategy. This behavior is manipulated via the DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY environment
variable.

Currently, the following distribution strategies are available:

* [legacy](http://www.orpiske.net/files/javadoc/maestro-java-1.5/apidocs/org/maestro/tests/cluster/LegacyStrategy.html): a distribution strategy the retains the legacy behavior. Useful for Maestro development and debugging.
* balanced: this strategy a balanced worker pool where half of the workers will be senders and the other half will be 
receivers 
* balanced-exclusive: the same as the `balanced` one, but forces the usage of peer-specific topics for communication, 
thus allowing the tests to manage the nodes individually instead of as a group. This requires a longer test startup time, 
since the test front-end will send the test parameters individually to each node, but allows a finer grained control over
each node behavior.  

**Test Endpoint Resolvers**

Test endpoint resolvers are used to dynamically assign test endpoints per worker. For example, it makes possible to 
assign different test endpoints based on the worker role. This behavior is manipulated via the ENDPOINT_RESOLVER_NAME environment
variable.

The following resolvers are available:

* role: this test endpoint resolver assigns a test endpoint (ie.: the broker URL, address, etc) based on the worker role. 
For example, if you are testing multi node scenarios (ie.: clustered broker, multi node QPid Dispatch, etc) and wants to
 use a different address for the senders than for the receivers.
* one-to-one: this resolver handles the test endpoint on a per worker+role basis ensuring that each sender/receiver 
instance will have a dedicated queue/topic/address for the test data exchange.  For example, if you have a balanced pool
 of 4 workers (2 senders and 2 receivers) and the test uses `amqp://sut:5672/test.performance.queue` as the send/receive 
 URL, then each sender/receiver pair will use `amqp://sut:5672/test.performance.queue.[N]` as the send/receiver URL 
 (ie.: `amqp://sut:5672/test.performance.queue.1` for the first pair,  `amqp://sut:5672/test.performance.queue.2` for 
 the second pair, etc). This test **must** use the `balanced-exclusive` distribution strategy.

Usage - Runtime Parameters and Message Customization
----

The following parameters can be set for the JMS worker/client:

| Parameter Name    | Default Value       | Description          |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `protocol` | `AMQP` | The underlying messaging protocol to use (one of AMQP, OPENWIRE, ARTEMIS, RABBITAMQP) |

| `sessionMode` | `1` | JMS Session mode (1 = Auto ACK, 2 = client ACK, 3 = Dups OK, 0 = session transacted) |


Running Default Tests
----

Once the test parameters have been adequately set by exporting the test variables. The test can be 
run with one of the following commands:

```
maestro-cli exec -s ../scripts/singlepoint/IncrementalTest.groovy -d /path/to/save/reports
```

Some test might need to be run directly via Groovy. This is the case for the tests
that require specific dependencies for processing their data. For example, to run
the Quiver test:

```
cd /path/to/scripts/singlepoint/ && groovy QuiverTest.groovy /path/to/save/reports
```

Generating the Reports
----

After a test is completed, performance reports can be generated using the following command line:

```
maestro-cli report -l info -d /path/to/save/reports
```

Please consider checking the help with the --help option, since some test behaviors and parameters can
be adjusted (ie.: warm-up).
