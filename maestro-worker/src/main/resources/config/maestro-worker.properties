# Common worker properties

# Data server port. Defaults to random if unset
# data.server.port=8000

# Data server host can be used to override the automatically detected
# hostname/IP address
# data.server.host=my.fqdn.host.com

# Use a fixed host to override the host detection mechanism
# maestro.worker.host

# The amount of time, in milliseconds, between each update of the latency reporting information.
# This also affects how fresh the latency information is when evaluating the FCL for go/no-go
# purposes
# maestro.worker.reporting.interval=10000


# Default policy when evaluating the FCL. Acceptable values are either 'hard' or 'soft'. The value hard means that if
# the latency *ever* the threshold set by the front-end, then the test is aborted. The value 'soft' means that the
# current latency threshold will be checked against a percentile defined on 'maestro.worker.fcl.soft.percentile'.
# The default FCL policy is 'soft'.
# maestro.worker.fcl.default.policy=soft

# The percentile used to check the latency threshold for the 'soft' FCL policy
# maestro.worker.fcl.soft.percentile=90.0
